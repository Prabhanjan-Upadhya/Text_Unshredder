# Text_Unshredder
We have typed a passage onto a sheet of paper and then passed the sheet of paper through a linear paper shredder.
The result is 19 strips of paper that are scrambled up and represented below (best viewed using a fixed width font).

Explanation:

The above text can be viewed as 19 columns, each separated by |. The order of these 19 columns have been randomly selected. It is possible, by changing the order of the columns back to the original order, to reveal the original text.

Your task is to build an executable capable of taking in scrambled data of this format, and reconstructing what it hypothesizes is the original text.
